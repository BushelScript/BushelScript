## Build BushelScript from source

Building from source is always an option, and is pretty straightforward if you have Xcode installed and know your way around the command line.

To build BushelScript and create an installer package:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine. (`git clone https://github.com/BushelScript/BushelScript.git` in a Terminal prompt, or download the zip file from the web interface).
2. Make sure [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode) is installed.
3. In the directory that `git clone` created: `./make-pkg.sh`

Now you can `open BushelScript.pkg` (or double-click it) to run the installer.

If you're having trouble, please open an issue detailing the problem.
