# Uninstall BushelScript

## v0.4.0 and later

To uninstall BushelScript, you can simply delete the `.app` package. As with any Mac app, if you want to delete any caches the system made for it, consider using an uninstaller/cleaner program. If you have the command line tool installed, you may wish to uinstall it from Preferences first, but leaving it shouldn't cause any harm (it will just be a broken link).

If you installed any additonal components like libraries or language modules outside of the app package, just delete them from wherever you put them. See [WHAT_GETS_INSTALLED.md](WHAT_GETS_INSTALLED.md) for where to find them if you've forgetten.

## v0.3

To uninstall BushelScript, delete the following files and directories:

- `/Library/BushelScript`
- `/Applications/BushelScript Editor.app`
- `/usr/local/bin/bushelscript`
