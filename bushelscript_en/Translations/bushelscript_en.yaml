                        If a direct argument is given, it is passed to the function. For named functions, this becomes the direct parameter. For blocks, the direct argument is made the current target in the block body, and:
                          • if the direct argument is a list, its items are assigned to the block parameters in order
                          • otherwise (if the direct argument is not a list), it is assigned to the first block parameter.

                        Simulate opening an app or selecting its dock icon while it's already open. This is a standard AppleScript command that all apps understand. If handled by an app, the app may perform some app-specific action, such as opening an untitled document, a template chooser, or a startup window.

                        Open and immediately print (without a preview!) files in an app. This is an AppleScript command that many apps understand. If handled by an app, the app should attempt to open the document(s) given in the direct parameter, then print them with the default settings for the default printer. You may not be offered a preview or other confirmation, use at own risk!
