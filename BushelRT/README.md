#  BushelRT

This framework includes the runtime componentry of BushelScript:

- The code generator, which produces LLVM IR (intermediate representation) and can run it in an LLVM JIT environment (`Codegen`)
- Built-in runtime functionality, calls to which are generated by the IR generator (`Built-in Functions`)
- A runtime object system with some built-in types and support for dynamically created types (`Runtime Objects`)
- Program information structures optimized for runtime use (`Runtime Info`)
- Internally used utilities (`Utilities`)
