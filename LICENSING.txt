Different parts of this project may be licensed differently.
The status quo is as follows:

• Bushel (parsing; "frontend"): Pending decision
• BushelLanguage (language module internal and consumer API): Pending decision
• Language modulesL
	• BushelScriptEnglish (bushelscript_en; primary English module): Pending decision
	• BushelScriptPirate (bushelscript_argh; toy alternative module): Pending decision; will probably
		have same license as BushelScriptEnglish, since the code is largely duplicated
• BushelRT (codegen and runtime library; "backend"): Pending decision
• bushelscript (BushelScript command-line interface): GPL v3+
• BushelScript Editor (graphical editor application): GPL v3+

External projects and their licensing terms are as follows:

• SwiftAutomation/SwiftAE (AppleEvent library with roots in objc-appscript):
    Released into public domain by its author (whose pseudonym is ‘has’). See swiftae/README § Etc.
    Modifications have been made to simplify the interface by removing parts that aren't needed in BushelRT.
    I also hereby dedicate any such modifications to the public domain.
• LLVMSwift (excellent Swift bridge for the LLVM C API):
    © 2017 Harlan, MIT licensed. See LLVMSwift/LICENSE.txt.
• LLVM (compiler infrastructure; compiles programs using an “intermediate representation”, or IR):
