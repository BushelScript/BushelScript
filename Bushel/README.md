#  Bushel

This framework includes the basic language-agnostic data structures and algorithms used by other BushelScript frameworks:

- Algorithms to inspect and pretty print source code (`AST-dervied Output`)
- A language-agnostic, enum-based abstract syntax tree (`AST`)
- Terminology structures, storage and organization methods, and declarative creation facilities (`Terminology`)
- A few utility `extension`s (`Utilities`)
