#  BushelLanguage

This framework defines the API for language modules and provides consumer API for language-specific functionality:

- Language module connection algorithms and API definitions (`Language Modules`)
    - Read this code if you want to write a language module, in the absence of official documentation (which should come eventually).
- Source code auto-fix description structures and application algorithms (`Auto-fixes`)
- Some utilities used by the framework which are also available to language module code (`Utilities`)
